  1. First sub point under your first item
  2. Second sub point under your first item
2. This is another item:
  * a sub item
  * another item.


This is a short paragraph.

This is a second short paragraph. The Markdown contains an empty line (by pressing return twice) between the two paragraphs.

This paragraph contains a line break   
midway through.  
This will be rendered on a new line as well (they were created by adding 2 spaces and pressing return once).
