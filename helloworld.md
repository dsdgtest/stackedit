A nested list looks like this:

1. This is a list item
    1. First sub point under your first item
    2. Second sub point under your first item.
2. This is another item
    * a sub item
    * another sub item.


1. Item 1
    1. A corollary to the above item.
    2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
  * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
    * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3


* A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
1. Item 1
  1. A corollary to the above item.
  2. Yet another point to consider.
2. Item 2
  * A corollary that does not need to be ordered.
    * This is indented four spaces, because it's two spaces further than the item above.
    * You might want to consider making a new list.
3. Item 3  

##This is heading 2
###This is a heading 3
add your content
*here*


2. This is another item
* a sub item
* another sub item.

And I have also added a
## heading
and a
